<h1> &#128170;Beyond Medals – What Defines Me: </h1>
<p>This sport is my passion and purpose. I train 7 hours a day, 6 days a week, focusing not just on
physical routines, but also on mindset, recovery, and nutrition. I aim to be the best version of myself
— not just for my own goals, but for what I want to contribute to the sport.</p>
<p>Consistency, focus, and discipline are what drive me. Gymnastics comes from falling, getting up, and
trying again thousands of times. That’s where my dedication, patience, and inner drive come in.
Every single day is an opportunity to move closer to my potential.</p>
